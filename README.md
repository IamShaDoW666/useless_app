### Project Description
Our app is designed to incorporate three intentionally quirky and creative projects, each with its own unique purpose. The first project is a color identifier that interacts with the camera. When a particular color is detected, the app recognizes and displays it, making for a playful exploration of color recognition. The second project is a non-functional timer, designed to visually up but with no real purpose‚Äîit simply exists, poking fun at our reliance on timers and tools. Lastly, we have a translator that humorously returns the exact same input as output, rendering it comically useless. This trio of projects represents a playful journey through technology, combining simplicity with a touch of humor to remind users of the joy in creating things that don't always have to serve a critical purpose.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How to detect the color of an object?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our application can take an image and replicate the color of the image.
